Yet, when it comes to the "production-ready" LLMs such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, there's a marked distinction in performance and usability. These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with human preferences (Guidabande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the open-source community.

### Instruction Tuning
Wei et al. (2021) obtained zero-shot performance on unseen tasks by fine-tuning LLMs on numerous datasets. Chung et al. (2022) and Zhong et al. (2023) investigate the impact of instruction tuning as a function of number of tasks, model size, prompt styles, etc. Prompts used for instruction tuning can be created by humans or by LLMs themselves (Zhou et al., 2022), and follow-up instructions can be used to refine initial generations to make them more useful, engaging, and unbiased (Ganguli et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023). An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022), in which models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase the likelihood that their final answer is correct.

RLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant improvements in their performance (Christian et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al. (2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications. In this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the models' responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.

Ouyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix issues with toxicity, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai et al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled fine-tuning data with the model’s own self-citations and revisions, and by ranking human raters with a model when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from All Feedback” (RLAIF).

### Known LLM Safety Challenges
Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked with Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) outline various hazards like bias, toxicity, private data leakage, and the potential for malicious use. Solaiman et al. (2023) categorize these impacts into two groups—those that can be assessed within the system and those requiring a societal context evaluation, while Kumar et al. (2022) offers potential mitigations aimed to curb harm. Work from Roller et al. (2020) and Dinan et al. (2021) also illuminates the difficulties tied to chatbots/modern LLMs, with concerns ranging from privacy to misleading experiences (see Deng et al., 2023) proposing a taxonomic framework to tackle these issues, and Bergman et al. (2022) delves into the balance between potential positive and negative impacts for reasoning dialogue models.

Investigations into red teaming reveal specific challenges in tuned LLMs, with studies by Ghang et al. and Zhu et al. (2023) showcasing a variety of successful attack types and their effects on the generation of harmful content. National security agencies and various researchers, such as (Mialon et al., 2023), have also raised red flags around advanced emergent model behaviors, cyber threats, and potential misuse in areas like biological warfare. Lastly, broader societal issues like job displacement due to accelerated AI research and on over-reliance on LLMs leading to training data degradation are also pertinent considerations (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018; Autor and Salomon, 2018; Webb, 2019; Shumailov et al., 2023). We are committed to continuing our work engaging with the broader policy, academic, and industry community on these issues.

## 7 Conclusion
In this study, we have introduced LLaMA 2, a new family of pretrained and fine-tuned models with scales of 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. These models have demonstrated their competitiveness with existing open-source chat models, as well as competency that is equivalent to some proprietary models on evaluation sets we examined, although they still lag behind other models like GPT-4. We meticulously elaborated on the methods and techniques employed in achieving our models, with a heavy emphasis on their alignment with the principles of helpfulness and safety. To contribute more significantly to society for the pace of research, we have responsibly opened access to LLaMA 2 and LLaMA-2-Chat. As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency and safety, we plan to make further improvements to LLaMA 2 and LLaMA-2-Chat in future work.
