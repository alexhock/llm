## Summary and Observations

The above analysis indicates contamination levels for various datasets and model subsets. 

- It is evident that HellaSwag and MMLU-Humanities demonstrate varying degrees of contamination, especially noticeable in the "Dirty" categories.
- MMLU-Overall shows the least contamination in the "Clean" subsets, while the "Dirty" subsets exhibit high contamination percentages.
- Central Limit Theorem implications suggest that as sample sizes increase, the distributions tend toward normality.

Results from the analysis indicate that HellaSwag and MMLU-Humanities may have benefited from dataset contamination, particularly the model types employed.

## Table Reference

Results may have variations due to segmentation of the dataset and others. This is summarized in Table 51, validating that model performance can be influenced by contamination within training datasets.
